## Recommended Browsers

Any modern web browser should work fine. Avoid Internet Explorer: it has been deprecated by Microsoft and is no longer supported.

For best support, it is recommended to use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. They dominate the market, so there are a lot of resources and articles available to help troubleshoot any problems.

Other browsers such as Ungoogled Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, Librewolf, Floorp, Thorium, etc. will also work. These browsers are all based on the Big Two with some customizations, so they work about 90% the same, but non-technical users may run into difficulties and help articles are less readily available.

## Browser Add-ons

Two browser add-ons are **required**.

* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) is our password manager. We store all of our logins there. Please do not write logins down or use your browser's Save Password feature. Bitwarden is much more secure than paper of your browser's Save Password fuction. Ask your supervisor for the Bitwarden login and commit it to memory. It also has a handy auto-fill feature that makes logging in a breeze! :D

* [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) blocks all sorts of ads and malicious content. It is the easiest way to avoid viruses and malware. You should install it on your computer at home, too.
